# ingress-annotator
The `ingress-annotator` is a Kubernetes controller designed to manage and reconcile annotations on Ingress resources based on rules defined in a ConfigMap. It ensures that the specified annotations are correctly applied to Ingress resources and maintains the state of applied rules. The primary purpose of this controller is to automate the management of Ingress annotations, making it easier to apply and update configurations across multiple Ingress resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Description
The `ingress-annotator` project consists of two main reconcilers: `ConfigMapReconciler` and `IngressReconciler`.

### ConfigMapReconciler

The `ConfigMapReconciler` monitors a specific ConfigMap defined by its namespace and name. When changes are detected in this ConfigMap, it updates the internal data store (`RulesStore`) and triggers a reconciliation process for all Ingress resources in the cluster. During this process, it marks Ingress resources with a specific annotation (`annotatorReconcileNeededKey`) if they are enabled for reconciliation.

### IngressReconciler

The `IngressReconciler` handles the actual application of annotations to the Ingress resources. It fetches the current and last applied rules from the annotations, identifies any rules that need to be removed or updated, and applies the necessary changes. The reconciler then updates the Ingress resource's annotations to reflect the applied rules and the version of the ConfigMap from which the rules were sourced.

### Key Features

- **Automated Annotation Management**: Automatically applies and updates annotations on Ingress resources based on a ConfigMap.
- **Reconciliation Logic**: Ensures that only enabled Ingress resources are reconciled and that annotations are accurately managed.
- **Version Tracking**: Keeps track of the ConfigMap version to determine if an update is necessary for each Ingress resource.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/ingress-annotatior:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/ingress-annotator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/ingress-annotator:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/ingress-annotator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
